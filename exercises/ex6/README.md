# Exercise 6 - Manage your Feature in Cloud ALM & Deployment

In this exercise, we will manage the assignment and deployment of Cloud Transport Management service transport requests in SAP Cloud ALM. By managing the lifecycle of your Feature you can keep track of your changes with a governed process. This includes confirmation of successful test in Quality Assurance and the approval for the deployment to the Production environment. Eventually you can validate the deployed application in the Production environment.

## Exercise 6.0 - Manage the lifefcylce of your feature

1. Go to the **Features** application in [SAP Cloud ALM](https://xp266-calm-lf1zy9xc.eu10-004.alm.cloud.sap/launchpad#Shell-home).
2. Go to **your Feature** created in Exercise 2.

## Exercise 6.1 - Deploy and monitor changes in your Quality Assurance and Production environment

1. The **transports in the Transports** section are **released** and show the **CTMS target node** as target tenant.

3. The Status of the transports is changed to "Deployment Scheduled in QA".

     <br>![alt text](../ex6/images/deployment_scheduled_QA.png)
4. Use the **Refresh button** on the Transports Section **to retrieve the import results**.

    <br>![alt text](../ex6/images/refresh_QA.png)
4. As soon as the imports have been succesful the **status changes to "Deployed in QA"**.

     <br>![alt text](../ex6/images/deployed_in_QA.png)
5. Now you can **change the Feature status to "In Testing"** by clicking **"Handover to Test"**.

    <br>![alt text](../ex6/images/handover_test.png)
6. The action "Confirm Successful Test" will be **executed centrally**.
7. Click on **"Analytics"** in the top right corner to **access the Feature Traceability**.

    <br>![alt text](../ex6/images/feature_traceability_nav.png)
8. Check whether your feature is in **status "Successfully Tested"**.

    <br>![alt text](../ex6/images/feature_traceability.png)
9. Navigate back to the feature and **approve the Feature for Production** by clicking "Approve for Production".

    <br>![alt text](../ex6/images/approve_for_prod.png)
10. In status "Approved for Production" you can **trigger the deployment to production by clicking "Deploy"** in the Transports section. Confirm the dialog for the deployment to target tenant PRD.

11. Refresh the section to retrieve the import results.

## Exercise 6.2 - Find and access the deployed applications

1. Before confirming the Feature deployment to Prodiuction you can check in the Production environment for your deployed application.

2. Acces your bookshop application and the Mobile Service to validate the correct funtion of them

3. After validating the correctness you can confirm the Fyour Feature in SAP CLoud ALM by clicking "Confrim Deployment".

    <br>![alt text](../ex6/images/confirm_deployment.png)
4. The status "Deployed" is the final state of the Feature. It cannot be changed anymore.

## Summary
In this exercise you have learned how to deploy changes via Feature in SAP Cloud ALM through your landscape. In addition you were able to keep track by using the Feature Traceability and confirm the correct function in Production.
