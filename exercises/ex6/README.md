# Exercise 6 - Manage your Feature in Cloud ALM & Deployment

In this exercise, we will manage the assignment and deployment of Cloud Transport Management service transport requests in SAP Cloud ALM. By managing the lifecycle of your Feature you can keep track of your changes with a governed process. This includes confirmation of successful test in QA and the apporval for the deployment to the production environment. Eventually you can validate the deployed application in the production environment.
